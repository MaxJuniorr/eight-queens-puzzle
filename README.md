# eight-queens-puzzle
In this repository, we will solve the eight queens problem using the following algorithms

## Stochastic hill climbing
Stochastic Hill Climbing is a variation of the Hill Climbing algorithm that makes small random modifications to candidate solutions and accepts the new solution if it improves the objective function. Unlike traditional Hill Climbing, it may accept non-optimal changes to avoid getting stuck in local maxima/minima, allowing for broader exploration of the search space.

## Genetic Algorithm
The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is an optimization algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection. It employs genetic concepts such as mutation, crossover, and selection to evolve solutions over multiple generations. Fitter solutions have a higher chance of passing their characteristics to the next generation, enabling efficient exploration of the solution space in search of the optimal answer.
